## Quick Start 

You can use the following commands to get started working with St. Jude Cloud University.

```bash
# install all of the dependencies
npm install

# run a development mode server
npm run develop

# create a production build in the `public/` folder
npm run build
```

### Development

Development of the St. Jude Cloud University codebase is relatively simple.
Follow these guidelines to keep you between the rails 👍:

1. Use [the commands in the quick start section](#quick-start) to set up the code base, install dependencies, run a development server, and execute your own production build.
2. This project enforces [conventional commits] using the [`conventional-changelog`] verbs. A large chunk of automation is built off of this convention, so please follow it!
   - Reading the above material is suggested, but not required for development.
   - If, in practice, you use `git cz` (which calls [`commitizen`] underneath the hood) instead of `git commit`, then this will be taken care of. This is the suggested method for beginners. 
   - If you're updating content (e.g. the documentation) and not source code, be sure to use the appropriate verb (e.g. use `docs:` for documentation upgrades).
3. The following integrations have been enabled or are in development. As such, you don't need to do anything other than commit!     

    - [x] Automated building with [GatsbyJS] 🧰. 
    - [x] Automated versioning with [conventional commits], [`conventional-changelog`], and [semantic-release] 🗂.
    - [x] Automated production release and branch previews with [Netlify] 🚀.
    - [x] Automated search engine indexing with [Algolia] 🔎.
    - [x] Automated integration with [Intercom] for support questions in browser 💬.
    - [ ] Automated spell checking 📚.
    - [ ] Automated link validation 🔗.
