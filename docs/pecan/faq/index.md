1. **Will I be charged for using St. Jude Cloud PeCan?**

You will **not** incur any costs for using PeCan. This is an open source tool for exploring curated datasets. 

2. **Will St. Jude Cloud host my institution's data in the data browser or on PeCan?**

If you are interested in submitting data to St. Jude Cloud, please contact us at [support@stjude.cloud](support@stjude.cloud).

3. **How do I get to ProteinPaint?**

A user may search for a gene from the homepage which will default the hg19 reference genome and Pediatric data set. 
  
A user can go directly into the Variant Resources data facet and navigate to the ProteinPaint tab which will default the hg19 reference genome and Pediatric data set.

A user may also filter from the sunburst and explore the Variant Resources data facet which will default the subtype for the defaulted Pediatric data set. 

!!!tip
There are other data sets (e.g. ClinVar, COMSIC, etc), depending on reference genome selected. Users can search genes using the search bar.

4. **How do I navigate through PeCan?**

A user can begin searching a gene from the homepage 

A user can use the navigational toolbar to browse from data facet to data facet.

5. **What use cases does this platform serve?**

A user can explore variant data, histological images, mutational signatures, and RNA-Seq expression data.

6. **What can I find in the data hosted on PeCan?**

PeCan custom interfaces are supported by various data types from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and collaborators. Based on the available data type, a user can explore variant prevalance, cancer hotspots, pathogenic information, mutational signatures identified in subtypes or cohorts, histological images for various subtypes, and RNA-Seq expression data.

7. **What are data facets?**

Data Facets represent a distinct type of post-processed genomic data for collections of pediatric cancer samples. Each can be explored via a designated interface.

8. **What is PIE? Is it free?**

Pecan PIE (the Pediatric Cancer Variant Pathogenicity Information Exchange) is a cloud-based variant classification and interpretation service. It annotates and ranks variants by putative pathogenicity, then displays them in an interactive web interface for formal review and classification following ACMG guidelines. The portal also contains a repository of expert-reviewed germline mutations that may predispose individuals to cancer. It is free for non-commercial use. For more information go [here](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/pecan-pie/). 

9.  **What features are coming next?**

St. Jude Cloud is working with the COMET team to develop the Epigenetic Data Facet that will comprise of Methylation data visualized as a tSNE plot.

10.  **How do I request data from PeCan?**

ProteinPaint and GenomePaint allow users to open data information by selecting the data tab in the Variant Resources: Oncoprint, GenomePaint, and ProteinPaint tabs. 

11.  **Where is the data from?**

See our [Data Availability](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/data/) page for more details. 

12.   **Can I build cohorts?**

This feature will be implemented in a future iteration. Check out our quarterly newsletter for updates by subscribing [here](https://hospital.stjude.org/apps/forms/fb/st-jude-cloud-subscribe/). 

13. **How can I suggest a new feature?**

We would love to hear your feedback and any ideas you may have for future feature developments. Contact us at [support@stjude.cloud](support@stjude.cloud).
