1. **Will I be charged for using St. Jude Cloud: PeCan?**

You will **not** incur any costs for using PeCan. This is an open source tool for exploring curated datasets. 

2. **How do I navigate through PeCan?**

A user can begin searching a gene or variant.

A user can use the navigational membrane to browse from data facet to data facet. 

A user can select begin exploring all the data available for a selected data facet. 


3. **How do I navigate to ProteinPaint?**

A user may search for a gene which will default with the hg19 reference genome and Pediatric dataset. 
  
A user can go directly into the Variant Resources data facet and navigate to the ProteinPaint tab which will default with the hg19 reference genome and Pediatric dataset.

A user may also filter from the sunburst and explore the Variant Resources data facet which will default the with the Pediatric dataset and underneath provide the subtype view. 

!!!tip
There are other data sets (e.g. ClinVar, COMSIC, etc), depending on reference genome selected. Additionally, the user can move coordinates by using the internal search within the UI.

4. **What are data facets?**

Data Facets represent a distinct type of post-processed genomic data for collections of pediatric cancer samples. Each can be explored via a designated interface.

5. **What use cases does this platform serve?**

See our [use case]() section for examples. 


6. **What is PIE? Is it free?**

Pecan PIE (the Pediatric Cancer Variant Pathogenicity Information Exchange) is a cloud-based variant classification and interpretation service. It annotates and ranks variants by putative pathogenicity, then displays them in an interactive web interface for formal review and classification following ACMG guidelines. The portal also contains a repository of expert-reviewed germline mutations that may predispose individuals to cancer. It is free for non-commercial use. For more information go [here](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/pecan-pie/). 

7.  **How do I request data from PeCan?**

At this time, a user cannot request samples from PeCan. The data will need to be requested through our Genomics Platform [Data Browser](https://platform.stjude.cloud/data/diseases/paired-tumor-normal).

!!!warning
Not all of the data found in PeCan is accessible in St. Jude Cloud's Genomics Platform. We do not host any of our collaborator's data at this time.

8. **Will St. Jude Cloud host my institution's data in the data browser or on PeCan?**

If you are interested in submitting data to St. Jude Cloud, please contact us at [support@stjude.cloud](support@stjude.cloud).

9.   **Where is the data from?**

See our [Data Availability](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/data/) page for more details. 

10.    **Can I build cohorts?**

This feature will be implemented in a future iteration. However, a user can lasso samples in the Expression facet, gather a list of samples from the table view in Mutational Signatures, populate data tables from ProteinPaint and GenomePaint.

11.  **What features are coming next?**

St. Jude Cloud is working with the COMET team to develop the Epigenetic Data Facet that will comprise of Methylation data visualized as a tSNE plot. We are also working with the COMET team to build an image search where it will compare H&E slides with histological images in our database. Additionally, we are working on cohort building and sample pages. We would love to hear your feedback and any ideas you may have for future feature developments.
