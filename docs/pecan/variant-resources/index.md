# VARIANT RESOURCES 

Analysis of samples from St. Jude, NCI (National Cancer Institute) TARGET, DKFZ, Shanghai Children’s Hospital, and Broad Institute from a protein domain 2D perspective.  

## ONCOPRINT  

A user will default to a placeholder if no subtype is selected from the Sunburst. (Figure 1). Diagnosis and Subtype are required for submitting a new oncoprint (Figure 2). Once these filters are selected and submitted, then the new oncoprint will render. The user can customize the oncoprint by (de)selecting genes and sample IDs. By altering the filters, then the other tabular views will update to this newly selected data, however, the sunburst filtering will not update. Gene Category is still under revision.

**Figure 2:** Variant Resources: Oncoprint, with filtering. This figure can be generated by following the subtype-centric user experience where a (i) subtype was selected from the sunburst landing page or (ii) a user-selected Diagnosis and Subtype filter. The filters on the left will auto-populate based on the Sunburst filter selection and can later be customized. The oncoprint is generated by ProteinPaint and therefore if a user alters the configs within the ProteinPaint UI, the filters will not update, nor will PeCan save this state in the membrane.  

!!!tip 
The dynamic oncoprints generated are not made with a curated list of genes. However, the `Associated Study` link-outs navigate the user to Visualization Community to view a similar, curated, oncoprint that may have been represented with that subset of published data in PeCan.

## MUTATIONAL PREVALENCE 

The user will default to a placeholder if no subtype is selected on the Sunburst (Figure 3). Once these filters are selected and submitted, then the new mutational data (i-iii) will render for that cohort:  (i) the mutation type proportion (0-1) depicted as a bar plot displaying the proportion of each mutation type (consistent ordering of mutation types for each gene); (ii) mutations are depicted in a table view displaying somatic, germline and relapse mutation breakdown; (iii) total # of mutations are depicted in a table view of the total number of patients in the cohort harboring a gene mutation with a bar plot of the total number of mutations (Figure 4).

**Figure 4:** Mutational Prevalence Example, with filtering. This visualization will provide mutational data dependent upon the Diagnosis and Subtype selected. The Mutation Type legend will be the same as seen on the Oncoprint tab that was generated by ProteinPaint.

For some disease sets, we have identified the most important disease pathway for the gene and have categorized them as such. This information is represented via the use of headers.

## GENOMEPAINT  

The user will be given a GenomePaint view, supported by ProteinPaint, for all data (Figure 5) or for the selected subtype (Figure 6) underneath the full Pediatric dataset (see Table 1). If the user alters configs using the ProteinPaint UI (e.g., coordinate view) the PeCan platform will not save this state in the membrane or update any filters across other views. Note: selecting a variant is a part of altering the configs in the ProteinPaint UI and will open separately in a Variant Page view. 

 

The Diagnosis and Subtype filters are only editable. When the data in filters are edited, this will update the other views to this dataset. The user is allowed to change reference genomes for this instance, but it will not change across other views, filters, or the membrane.

**Figure 5.** GenomePaint Example, without filtering. This visualization will provide the basic GenomePaint view where the Ref Gene for the full Pediatric dataset will show. The user can navigate the UI using the GenomePaint configs. Only coordinates or gene HUGO names are accepted.

**Figure 6.** GenomePaint Example, with filtering. This visualization will provide the basic GenomePaint view where the Ref Gene, Pediatric dataset, and the selected subtype data will show. The user can navigate the UI using the GenomePaint configs. Only coordinates or gene HUGO names are accepted.  



### GENOMEPAINT DATASET: 

 
| Ref Genome | Dataset            |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| hg19       | Pediatric, PAN-ALL |
| hg38       | Pediatric, SJLIFE  |

**Table 1.** GenomePaint datasets. (hg19) Pediatric, PAN-ALL versus (hg38) Pediatric, SJLIFE data sets available.  

 

## PROTEINPAINT  

The user will be given a ProteinPaint view for all data (Figure 7) or for the subtype filtered (Figure 8) for the selected subtype underneath the full Pediatric dataset (see Table 2) If the user alters configs using the ProteinPaint UI (e.g., coordinate view) the PeCan platform will not save this state in the membrane or update any filters across other views. Note: selecting a variant is a part of altering the configs in the ProteinPaint UI and will open separately in a Variant Page view. 

 

The Diagnosis and Subtype filters are only editable. The user is allowed to change reference genomes for this instance, but it will not change across other views, filters, or the membrane.

**Figure 8.** ProteinPaint Example, with filtering. This visualization will provide the basic ProteinPaint view where the Pediatric dataset defaults and the variants for the gene are shown with the selected subtype variants underneath the lollipop full dataset. The user can navigate the UI using the ProteinPaint configs. Only coordinates or gene HUGO names are accepted.

# VARIANT PAGES (under scope) 

The user can access variant pages (Figure 9) by clicking, a variant in ProteinPaint, GenomePaint, by searching directly for that variant, or after signing in and submitting a PIE job. ProteinPaint and GenomePaint make a fetch to the PIE repository as soon as a variant is clicked, therefore, not all variants have Variant Pages because the pages have not yet been created. Variant Pages only exist for hg19.  

 

These pages are for use by our clinical analysts for variant classification and comprehensive data visualization as well as external professionals in the field. As one of St. Jude’s goals is to save kids worldwide, providing sufficient tools to clinicians and experts with no or little access to costly software for variant classification and visualization, would help them to better understand their patient’s cancer and potentially provide them with better care and treatment.
