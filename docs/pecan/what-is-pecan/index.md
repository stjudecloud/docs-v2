PeCan is the definitive pediatric resource that provides a centralized workspace for users to explore data through a subtype-centric or gene-centric user experience. In the futunext phase of PeCan, users will be able to explore cohorts across all integrated data types available. The data is comprised from various projects at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital such as [PCGP](https://www.stjude.cloud/studies/pediatric-cancer-genome-project/) dataset along with curated datasets from other collaborating institutions such as [TARGET](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target), [DKFZ](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html), and many others. For more information about what data is available go [here](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/data/).

# Homepage 
The [PeCan homepage](https://pecan.stjude.cloud/home) showcases key components of each feature available in PeCan. This comprises of the 4 data facets, PIE, and other features coming soon. To have a seemless user experience, we now have a navigational membrane that can be employed when exploring data across all data facets. A user can also immediately search a gene which will direct the user straight to ProteinPaint which is located in our Variant Resources data facet. This view will entail all the Pediatric data that ProteinPaint offers. If a user would like to engage in a subtype-centric experience, read the **Sunburst** section below.

# Sunburst
The sunburst plot gives an at-a-glance disease distribution and disease hierarchy along with the corresponding data facets that are available. You can click the various arch slices to glance at the number of samples and patients being represented by that disease. A user is encouraged to navigate through a subtype-centric experience by selecting a subtype and then navigating to each data facet. The diseases are categorized in two three main root /// categories: 1) HM -Hematopoietic Malignancies, 2) BT -Brain Tumor, 3) ST -Solid Tumor. The disease hierarchy used was developed by St. Jude Cloud. 

Additionally, a user can explore all of the available data within a data facet by clicking directly on the data facet icon.

# Data Facets
We provide 4 data facets (briefly described below) for users to explore. Data Facets represent a distinct type of post-processed genomic data for collections of pediatric cancer samples. Each can be explored via a designated interface. For example, Variant Resources is a data facet where all variant data can be visualized across the data that is available with this data type. CSV download functionality will exist in a later version. Check out our data facets section to learn more. 

**[Variant Resources](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/variant-resources/)** - visualizations to showcase variant data in an oncoprint format, variant prevalence, Genomepaint view, Proteinpaint view and specific variant pages.

**[Mutational Signatures](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/mut-sigs/)** - samples depicted in a heatmap where COSMIC mutational signatures in pediatric cancer subtypes were analyzed by WGS. 

**[Expression](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/expression/)** - the expression landscape of RNA-Seq fresh frozen tumor samples.

**[Histology](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/histology/)** - solid tumor samples that have histology imaging (all HNE) with some linked to the methylation data in the Epigenetic data facet. 

**[Epigenetic (coming soon)](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/epigenetic/)** - solid tumor samples methylation profiling that have linked histology images.

# PIE
Pecan PIE (the **Pe**diatric **Can**cer Variant **P**athogenicity **I**nformation **E**xchange) is a cloud-based variant classification and interpretation service. Click [here]() to learn more.
