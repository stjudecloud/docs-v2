PeCan is the definitive pediatric resource that provides a centralized workspace for users to explore data through a subtype-centric or gene-centric user experience. In the future, users will be able to select cohorts to be explored across all integrated data types. The data is comprised from various projects at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and its collaborating institutions.

# Homepage 
The [PeCan homepage](https://pecan.stjude.cloud/home) outlines key features for each of components the user can explore. This comprises of the 4 data facets, PIE, and other features coming soon. The data supporting this platform is made up of St. Jude Cloud's [PCGP](https://www.stjude.cloud/studies/pediatric-cancer-genome-project/) dataset along with curated datasets from other institutions such as [TARGET](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target), [DKFZ](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html), and many others.

From here, a user can start exploring by our search engine to explore genes, variants or diseases. Otherwise, the user can navigate back and forth through our membrane.

# Sunburst
The sunburst chart gives an at-a-glance disease distribution and disease hierarchy along with the corresponding data facets that are available. You can click the various arch slices to glance at the number of samples and patients being represented by that disease. A user is encouraged to navigate through a subtype-centric experience by selecting a subtype and then navigating to each data facet. The diseases are categorized in two three main root /// categories: 1) HM -Hematopoietic Malignancies, 2) BT -Brain Tumor, 3) ST -Solid Tumor. The disease hierarchy used was developed by St. Jude Cloud. 

Additionally, a user can explore all of the data within a data facet by clicking directly on the data facet.

# Data Facets
We provide 4 data facets (briefly described below) for users to explore. Data Facets are the view a user can see for that data type. For example, Variant Resources is a data facet where all variant data can be visualized across the data that is available with this data type. CSV download functionality will exist in a later version. Check out our data facets section to learn more. 

**[Variant Resources](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/variant-resources/)** - visualizations to showcase variant data in an oncoprint format, variant prevalence, Genomepaint view, Proteinpaint view and specific variant pages.

**[Mutational Signatures](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/mut-sigs/)** - samples depicted in a heatmap where COSMIC mutational signatures in pediatric cancer subtypes were analyzed by WGS. 

**Expression** - the expression landscape of RNA-Seq fresh frozen tumor samples.

**Histology** - solid tumor samples that have histology imaging (all HNE) with some linked to the methylation data in the Epigenetic data facet. 

**Epigenetic (coming soon)** - solid tumor samples methylation profiling that have linked histology images.

# [PIE](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/pecan-pie/)
Pecan PIE (the **Pe**diatric **Can**cer Variant **P**athogenicity **I**nformation **E**xchange) is a cloud-based variant classification and interpretation service. Click [here]() to learn more.
