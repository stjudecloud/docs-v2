PeCan is a definitive pediatric resource that provides a centralized workspace for users to explore over 9,000 unique genomic samples through a subtype-centric or gene-centric user experience.

The available data is composed of various projects at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital such as the [PCGP](https://www.stjude.cloud/studies/pediatric-cancer-genome-project/) dataset along with curated datasets from other collaborating institutions such as [TARGET](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target), [DKFZ](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html), and many others. To see all available data, see our [Data Sets](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/data/).

# Homepage 
The [PeCan homepage](https://pecan.stjude.cloud/home) showcases key components available in PeCan. This comprises of the 4 data facets, PIE, and highlights features coming soon. For a seemless user experience, a navigational membrane can be employed which saves the diagnoses selection from the sunburst. Additionally, a user can search a gene (with selection of reference genome) or variant from our navbar which will direct the user to our ProteinPaint tab or Variant tab located in our Variants data facet. The ProteinPaint view will auto-default the Pediatric data set (for more information go [here](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/data/)).

# Sunburst
The sunburst plot gives an at-a-glance disease distribution and disease hierarchy where all samples have been mapped to a WHOL pediatric cancer classification based ontology.
As a user selects a subtype within in the sunburst, the total number of patients and samples will update accordingly. The diseases are categorized in three main root categories: 1) HM -Hematopoietic Malignancies, 2) BT -Brain Tumor, and 3) ST -Solid Tumor. A user is encouraged to navigate via a subtype-centric experience by selecting a subtype and then navigating to each data facet for available data with that subtype. Conversely, a user can explore all of the available data within a data facet by clicking directly on the data facet icon instead of filtering by subtype on the sunburst.

# Data Facets
Data Facets represent a distinct type of post-processed genomic data for collections of pediatric cancer samples. Each can be explored via a designated interface. For example, Variant Resources is a data facet where all variant data can be visualized across the data that is available with this data type. CSV download functionality will exist in a later version. Check out our data facets section to learn more. 

**[Variant Resources](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/variant-resources/)** - visualizations to showcase variant data in an oncoprint format, variant prevalence display, GenomePaint view, ProteinPaint view and specific variant pages.

**[Mutational Signatures](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/mut-sigs/)** - samples depicted in a heatmap where COSMIC mutational signatures in pediatric cancer subtypes were analyzed by WGS. 

**[Expression](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/expression/)** - the expression landscape of RNA-Seq fresh frozen tumor samples.

**[Histology](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/histology/)** - solid tumor samples that have histology imaging (all HNE).

**[Epigenetic (coming soon)](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/epigenetic/)** - solid tumor samples methylation profiling that have linked histology images.

# PIE
Pecan PIE (the **Pe**diatric **Can**cer Variant **P**athogenicity **I**nformation **E**xchange) is a cloud-based variant classification and interpretation service. Click [here]() to learn more.
