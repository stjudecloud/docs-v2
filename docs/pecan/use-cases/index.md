---

The following are common use cases a user could achieve in PeCan. 

1. **As a user, I need the ability to know what the platform has to offer.**
   The [homepage](https://pecan-v2.staging.stjude.cloud/) is designed to familiarize the user with the components of the platform along with key features found in each. Additionally, the user can explore our [Help Guides](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/pecan/) which allows the user to read more about each data facet, including the data and methods to generate each facet. 
2. **As a user, I need the ability to add a VCF file and look at a list of variant details regarding the pathogenicty for variant classification. **
   A user can navgiate to [PIE](https://pecan-v2.staging.stjude.cloud/pie) and once signed in, the user can [submit a job](https://pecan-v2.staging.stjude.cloud/pie/submit-job) which allows the upload of a VCF file or the ability to enter a single variant.  
3. As a user, I need the ability to find the histology image for SJNBL030721_X6.
4. As a user, I need the ability to view and expect the histology image for SJNBL030721_X4 (same patient as #3 but different slide over time).
5. As a user, I need the ability to view clinical relevant notes for ahistology image.
6. As a user, I need the ability to copy or download a slide image.
