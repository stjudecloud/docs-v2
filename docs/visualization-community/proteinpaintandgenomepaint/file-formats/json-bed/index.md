**JSON-BED track format**


## File format

There are 4 columns, separated by **tab**:
1. Chromosome
2. Start position (0-based)
3. Stop position (not including the ending base)
4. JSON string

Each line is a genomic feature. The feature can be richly described in
the JSON string.

## Prepare and use a track 

```
sort -k1,1 -k2,2n [file] > [file.sorted]
mv [file.sorted] [file]
bgzip [file]
tabix -p bed [file].gz
```

To host the track on a web server: put both .gz and .gz.tbi files at the
same directory on the web server. Obtain the URL to the .gz file and
submit it to the browser.

To host the track on ProteinPaint server: put both .gz and .gz.tbi files
at the same directory under the <TP> directory. Obtain the relative
path to the .gz file and submit it to browser.

## JSON object for a BED item

The content is a string representation of an object (key-value pairs).
Examples:

```javascript
{"name":"CTCF1","strand":"+"}

{"name":"MIR6859-1","isoform":"NR_106918","strand":"-","exon":[[17368,17436]],"rnalen":68}
```

Format requirements:
-   No line breaks in the JSON text
-   Must include braces {}
-   Use double quotes for strings
-   Don't use quotes for numerical values
-   Keys are case-sensitive
-   Following names cannot be used as keys and will be ignored:
    -   **chr**
    -   **start**
    -   **stop**
    -   **canvas**

See full JSON spec at [http://json.org/](http://json.org/)

### "name": STR

Value is a string.

For genes, "name" is gene symbol.

When "**itemurl_appendname**" is specified, "name" is required to
enable clicking on an item from track display and trigger a URL .

### "isoform": STR

Gene isoform accession, e.g. NM_000546 or ENST00000269305

Both name and isoform can appear in the tooltip when hovering cursor
over the track display.

### "strand": STR

"+" or "-".

Unstranded if not provided.

### "exon":\[\]

Array of two-number arrays, e.g.
\[\[665562,665731\],\[665277,665335\],\[661138,665184\]\].

Must be present for genes.

All positions are 0-based.

The stop position of an exon is the nucleotide next to the last exonic
nucleotide, similar to the UCSC BED format.

For coding genes:

-   For coding genes:

    -   Value should be a union of UTRs and CDS.

-   For noncoding genes:

    -   Value should be all exons.

-   Despite there are already "utr5", "utr3", "coding", "intron" attributes, the "exon" attribute is still required.

### "intron":\[\]

Same format as "exon".

Required for native gene tracks.

The stop position of an intron is the first nucleotide in the exon.

### "utr5":\[\]

Same format as "exon".

Required for any 5' UTRs in coding genes.

### "utr3":\[\]

Same format as "exon".

Required for any 3' UTRs in coding genes.

### "rnalen": INT

Base-pair length of RNA transcript.

Required for all genes.

### "cdslen": INT

Base-pair length of coding region length of an mRNA transcript.

Required for coding gene.

Do not use for noncoding gene.

### "codingstart": INT

Genomic position of the smaller boundary of the coding sequence.

Required for coding gene.

Do not use for noncoding gene.

### "codingstop": INT

Genomic position of the bigger boundary of the coding sequence.

Required for coding gene.

### "coding":\[\]

Same as "exon", for coding exons only.

Set "translatecoding" to true in the track object to enable gene
translation according to the coding exons as well as coding frame
defined by the "coding:\[\]" attribute. The translation can happen when
the browser is at sufficient resolution.

### "description": STR

Some text, e.g. gene function.

### "color": STR

Rendering color of this item. Use follow color names:

-   Names such as "red" "green" listed in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors)

-   #FF0000

-   rgb(255,0,0)

### "category": STR

Value is string or integer. Value must be a key of the "categories"
attribute of the track object.

## Declaring a track as a JSON object

```javascript
{
"type":"bedj",
"name":"gene track",
"file":"anno/gencode.v24.hg19.gz",
"stackheight":14,
"stackspace":1
}
```

-   **stackheight**:20

    -   Height of rows in number of pixels. All rows share the same height.

    -   For gene tracks, this height will be the thickness of coding exons, while UTRs and noncoding exons will have height reduced by 4 pixels.

-   **stackspace**:1

    -   Spacing distance between rows.

-   **color**:"blue"

    -   Track rendering color for lines, boxes, and text labels.

    -   Per-item color defined in the track file will override this setting.

-   **onerow**:true

    -   Value is "1" for true.

    -   Forces all items in the view range to be displayed in the same row, and item names will be hidden.

    -   Useful for making compact representation of certain tracks, e.g. chromHMM.

    -   Delete this attribute to cancel the effect.

-   **categories**:{}

    -   List of categories, each item in the track will belong to one category and will be colored accordingly

    -   {"1":{"color":"red","label":"type 1"}, "2":{"color":"blue","label":"type 2"}, ... }

-   **translatecoding**:1

    -   Will translate genes when the resolution is fine enough. This requires the .coding\[\] attribute in the JSON objects of BED items.

-   **itemurl_appendname**: URL

    -   Allows clicking on an item from the track and open up a URL customized by the name of that item; item's name will be appended to the end of the URL as the value of a parameter.

    -   Example: given URL of "[http://google.com?query=]{.underline}](http://google.com?query=)". When clicked on an item named "HOX", this URL will be triggered: [[http://google.com?query=HOX](http://google.com?query=HOX)
