# New Feature
[Visualization Community](https://viz.stjude.cloud/) has collaborated with [ProteinPaint](https://proteinpaint.stjude.org/) to implement a new data download feature!
Our first data download dataset is available within the [Cancer Survivorship Community](https://viz.stjude.cloud/community/cancer-survivorship-community~4).

In order to gain access, you must 1) have a Data Access Agreement (DAA) from both CCSS and SJLIFE Data Access Units (DAU) and 2) be [signed in](https://viz.stjude.cloud/signin) to Visualization Community. 



## SJLIFE and CCSS DAA approval
