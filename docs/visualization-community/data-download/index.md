# New Feature
[Visualization Community](https://viz.stjude.cloud/) has collaborated with [ProteinPaint](https://proteinpaint.stjude.org/) to implement a new feature.
A clinical data set from the [Childhood Cancer Survivor Study](https://stjude.cloud/studies/clinical-genomics) and [St. Jude Life](https://sjlife.stjude.org/) Data Access Units have made a download feature available within the [Cancer Survivorship Community](https://viz.stjude.cloud/community/cancer-survivorship-community~4).

In order to gain access, you must 1) have an approved Data Access Agreement (DAA) from both CCSS and SJLIFE Data Access Units (DAU) and 2) be [signed in](https://viz.stjude.cloud/signin) to Visualization Community. 



## SJLIFE and CCSS DAA approval

!!!tip
- You can read more about the [Childhood Cancer Survivor Study](https://ccss.stjude.org/) which consists of germline-only whole genome sequencing samples of childhood cancer survivors. The following [data set](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/genomics-platform/about-our-data/dau-and-datasets/#childhood-cancer-survivor-study) is included within CCSS.
- You can read more about [St. Jude Life](https://sjlife.stjude.org/) which contains germline-only whole genome and whole exome sequencing data focused on studying the long-term adverse outcomes associated with cancer and cancer-related therapy. The following [data set](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/genomics-platform/about-our-data/dau-and-datasets/#st-jude-life) is included within SJLIFE.
!!!


First, navigate [here](https://platform.stjude.cloud/data/cohorts?selected_tags=SJC-DS-1002,SJC-DS-1005) to [St. Jude Cloud's Genomics Platform](https://platform.stjude.cloud/) which is already pre-selected for both CCSS and SJLIFE data sets. *If you want to custom select then you must go to [Studies](https://platform.stjude.cloud/data/cohorts) and manually select your data sets.*

Next, click [Log In (at the bottom)](https://platform.stjude.cloud/login) and sign in using the St. Jude SSO option. You *must* use the St. Jude Auth0 to sign on in order for the permissions to be accepted. If you are a SJ employee, you can use the first option, otherwise you can use the alternative GitHub, Gmail, or email options.

*To read more about Genomics Platform go [here](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/genomics-platform/), to learn more about creating a DNAnexus account or setting up billing go [here](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/genomics-platform/accounts-and-billing/).*


Then, you must complete the DAA. *To read more about making a DAA request go [here](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/genomics-platform/requesting-data/making-a-data-request/), or if you have any questions about filling out the DAA, please read more [here](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/genomics-platform/requesting-data/how-to-fill-out-daa/).*

!!!tip
On page 10 of the DAA, you must address in the **Contemplated Use** section that you are interested in accessing the portal data. 
**An example would be:**
I am a researcher in the Yu Lab at Brown University and we are studying factors for modifying cardiovascular system late effects in pediatric cancer survivors with cardiac toxic cancer treatments. I need access to the SJLIFE/CCSS cohort with this information (treatment and late effects), as well as demographics, lifestyle exposure, and genetic factors.
!!!


!!!warning
Your DAA must be approved before you have access to the download feature. You will be notified via email if/when the committee approves the request. This process typically takes less than 2 weeks.

## Accessing the portal 

First, [sign in](https://viz.stjude.cloud/signin) to VisCom. *If you need help creating an account or signing in please follow these [guidelines](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/visualization-community/sign-in/).*


Once you are signed in, you will navigate to the [Cancer Survivorship Community](https://viz.stjude.cloud/community/cancer-survivorship-community~4). Here, is where you can begin to explore the [Clinical Browser ](https://viz.stjude.cloud/cancer-survivorship/visualization/clinical-data-browser~18). 

Next, you will want to click **Charts**.

Now you can access the data download button to begin selecting the terms for downloading.
