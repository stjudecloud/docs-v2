title: Visualization Community (VisCom)
---

St. Jude Cloud's [Visualization Community (VisCom)](https://viz.stjude.cloud/) is a safe environment where you can explore, create and analyze curated visualizations that utilize [ProteinPaint](https://proteinpaint.stjude.org/) and [GenomePaint](https://genomepaint.stjude.cloud/). 


# Explore and Create
As of date, we have over 75 publicly curated visualizations, with an average of 1k views (greatest >12K), an optimized free-text search engine and filters to query metadata to allow a user to explore unique visualizations to spot trends and detect outliers in massive high-dimensional data. 

Once you find the visualization you need within VisCom, you can easily re-create it by any of the choices below: 
1.) copying the curated code block displayed for a visualization.
2.) by viewing our [library](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/visualization-community/basics) of curated code blocks.
3.) or explore our new visualization editor with curated pre-filled examples.

## Purpose
* You can explore shared visualizations by searching or filtering by institution, data type, lab, author, PubMedID, and even by diagnosis. 
* St. Jude's visualization tools [ProteinPaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/proteinpaint/) and [GenomePaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/genomepaint/) allow world class genomic or proteomic visualizations 
* Visualizations can be shared and managed before becoming publicly available. Teams can be developed to provide a secure, private workspace for instant collaboration. Once public, adding a permalink or PubMedID to the visualization increases the profile and accessibility to your figure(s). 
* We even offer [Communities](https://viz.stjude.cloud/communities) to share and unify research within a genre of research.

## Goals
* Create sophisticated visualizations ***without being a computational scientist or engineer***
* Unravel discoveries to accelerate life-saving research ***based on the visual analysis***
* Collaborate with others ***by exploring and sharing visualizations within a community or team***

## Support
* [ProteinPaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/proteinpaint/) and [GenomePaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/genomepaint/) are developed & supported by [Xin Zhou's Lab](https://www.stjude.org/directory/z/xin-zhou.html)

* Visualization Community is developed by the St. Jude Cloud team to facilitate scientific research using St. Jude-developed visualization tools.
