---
Are you stumped and needing guidance to find which visualizations to use to share in a meeting, publication, or webinar? Is generating dynamic visualizations challenging for you, or maybe you need to find an effortless tool to create a quick visualization? 

St. Jude Cloud's [Visualization Community application](https://viz.stjude.cloud/) is developed to solve all these issues and more. 

## Purpose
* By utilizing St. Jude's visualization tools [ProteinPaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/proteinpaint/) and [GenomePaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/genomepaint/), we allow world class genomic or epigenomic visualizations to be easily developed, accessed, and/or shared globally.

* You can explore the shared visualizations by [Data type](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/visualization-community/Supporteddatatypes/), [Tool](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools), Research Domain, or by chronological order of publication.

## Goals
* Create sophisticated visualizations ***without being a computational scientist or engineer***

* Unravel discoveries to accelerate live-saving research ***based on the visual analysis***

* Collaborate with others ***by exploring and sharing visualizations within a community or team***
