title: Visualization Community (VisCom)
---

St. Jude Cloud's [Visualization Community (VisCom)](https://viz.stjude.cloud/) is a safe environment where you can explore, create and analyze curated visualizations that utilize [ProteinPaint](https://proteinpaint.stjude.org/) and [GenomePaint](https://genomepaint.stjude.cloud/). 


# Explore and Create
With over 71 publicly curated visualizations, an average of 1k views (greatest >12K), and an optimized search engine with metdata filters allow a user to explore unique visualizations to spot trends and detect outliers in massive high-dimensional data. 

Once you find the visualization you need within VisCom, you can easily re-create it by copying the curated code block displayed for a visualization, by viewing our [library](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/visualization-community/basics) of curated code blocks, or explore our new visualization editor with curated examples in your account. 


## Purpose
* You can explore shared visualizations by searching or filtering by institution, data type, lab, author, PubMedID, and even by diagnosis. 
* By utilizing St. Jude's visualization tools [ProteinPaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/proteinpaint/) and [GenomePaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/genomepaint/), we allow world class genomic or proteomic visualizations to be easily developed, accessed, and/or shared globally. Each visualization saved in VisCom is private by default until a P.I. or team lead approves.
* Teams can be developed to provide a secure, private workspace for instant collaboration. Visualizations can be shared and managed before becoming publicly available. Once public, adding a permalink or PubMedID to the visualization increases the profile and accessibility to your figure(s). 
* We even offer [Communities](https://viz.stjude.cloud/communities) to share and unify research within a genre of research.

## Goals
* Create sophisticated visualizations ***without being a computational scientist or engineer***
* Unravel discoveries to accelerate life-saving research ***based on the visual analysis***
* Collaborate with others ***by exploring and sharing visualizations within a community or team***

## Support
* [ProteinPaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/proteinpaint/) and [GenomePaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/genomepaint/) is developed & supported by [Xin Zhou's group](https://www.stjude.org/directory/z/xin-zhou.html)

* Visualization Community is developed by the St. Jude Cloud team to facilitate scientific research using St. Jude-developed visualization tools.
