title: Public vs Private Visualizations
---
In this section, you will learn how to make a visualization public or how to share a private visualization. All visualizations default as private. 

# Public
Once you create a visualization, you can email [support@stjude.cloud](support@stjude.cloud) with your P.I. or Team Lead's approval to enable your visualization(s). Published visualizations can be given a permalink or associated to the PubMedID to increase their profile and accessibility.

Importantly, any approved the visualization will fall under the [privacy policy](https://www.stjude.cloud/privacy-policy/) and [terms](https://www.stjude.cloud/terms-of-use) of use of St. Jude such that St. Jude can remove any visualization if deemed necessary.

# Private
After creating a visualization email [support@stjude.cloud](support@stjude.cloud) to provide a direct link to your visualization so that it may be shared; otherwise, it will remain exclusively in your account.
