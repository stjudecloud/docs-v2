title: Public vs Private Visualizations
---
In this section, you will learn how to make a visualization public. 
By default, all visualizations are private and cannot become public until it goes through the access control approval process. You can draft visualizations in your own dashboard which will not be seen by your team until you assign the visualization a team in the Info section. This can be useful if you want to generate a template and then hand over the efforts to another colleague. 

### Approval Process:

To begin, complete all necessary fields or custom code block to render a visualization. Complete the details in the Info section. 
Click the Send for Review button in the Easy Editor View. 
Once you select this, it will prompt you to select a team so that the approval can be sent to the correct PI / Team Lead. Describe your visualization or notes you want your PI or Team Lead to review.
Your visualization header will be flagged red to indicate that it is under review.
When your PI or Team Lead is reviewing, it will be flagged yellow. 
The PI or Team Lead will need to review the data in Tracks and Info before approving.

If the PI or Team Lead needs you to make revisions, they can select this button.
Your visualization header will be flagged red to indicate that you need to make edits.
Once you are done, you must select the Send for Review button again to go through the process.

If the PI or Team Lead selects Approve then this will change the header to your visualization to green which indicates this visualization can be made public. The PI or Team Lead can toggle this in the Info Section of the visualization. 

After you complete the approval process and the PI or team lead approves the visualization, the ability to make it public versus private will be available within the info section of the visualiation editor.

Once it is toggled to public, this will be shown in Visualization Community, whereas if you toggle it to private, then it will only exist in the teams and user list.
If you need to change the owner of the visualization, please contact [support@stjude.cloud](support@stjude.cloud).
