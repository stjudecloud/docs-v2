title: How to Build a Template
---
In this section, you will learn how to build a visualization template to render. If you need help managing your data or selecting a curated code block the tutorial will guide you to those specific sections. 

## Open a New Template
Once you are logged in and have selected a team from the list, then select the **Visualizations** tab.

All the visualizations made for that team will populate. 

Scroll to the bottom of the list and select **Create Visualization** to render a template.

This will populate an empty template. Now you are able to create a new visualization. You may select a thumbnail image to represent your visualization and fill in the following fields:
* Title
* PubMed ID 
* Released Date
* Description

*If you do not select an image, our platform will render one for you by the end of the day.*

## Learn the Code Block Basics

## Build Your Code

Now that you learned about how the code block works, let's select a code block for the visualization you want to create. Go to the **Code Block Library** on the left and select which data type you will be using to create your visualization.

Next, let's learn which example you need to copy and paste into the VisCom editor so that ProteinPaint can access your data and render your visualization. Each example either has a ```file``` or ```url``` parameter. Some visualizations may have more than 1 ```url``` parameter; if this happens, the library example will explain what to do. 

# Manage your Data
Go to the next chapter **Manage your Data** if you need help finding how to fill in your ```url``` or ```file``` parameter: 
* if you have your data stored in DNAnexus.
* if you have your data stored on your local and want to upload to DNAnexus.
* if you have your data stored on the HPC and want to move them to DNAnexus.
* if you have your data stored on the HPC.

After you select the code block, depending on where the data lives, and update the specified lines in the example you can save your visualization!

# Render your visualization
In order to render the visualization, click ‘Update Visualization’ within VisCom.

Next, click the ‘Go Back’ button in VisCom. Then, click the title to render it.

If you have any errors due to file formatting or within the ```runproteinpaint``` () the error will be validated and shown. Therefore, go back to your list of visualizations and click the icon to edit.
