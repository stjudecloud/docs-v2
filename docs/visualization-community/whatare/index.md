* [ProteinPaint](https://proteinpaint.stjude.org/) is the flagship protein-based visualization tool created at St. Jude. You can use it to examine the domains of genes, known isoforms of a given gene, hotspot mutations for single nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions and deletions (Indels), and structural variations (SVs) in both pediatric and adult cancers, and RNA-Seq expression of a given protein in different tumour types.  

* ProteinPaint showcases a Genome Browser that utilize various track types to showcase different genomic views. Furthermore, there are other Apps that can be run to show visualizations such as Scatterplots, Single Cell and even Heatmaps to name a few.

* [GenomePaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/genomepaint/) visualizes somatic coding and noncoding alterations from ~3,800 pediatric tumors, along with multi-omics information to reveal oncogene activation by noncoding alterations, enhancer hijacking, aberrant splicing, mutual-exclusivity, mutation signature, and perform Kaplan-Meier analysis. It can be used to visualize your own data with easy customization and embedding on your own page.
