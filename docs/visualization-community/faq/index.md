KeyWord(s): VisCom (Visualization Community)

**What is Visualization Community?**
* [Visualization Community](https://viz.stjude.cloud/) is a safe environment where you can explore public research visualizations, learn to use [ProteinPaint](https://proteinpaint.stjude.org/)/[GenomePaint](https://genomepaint.stjude.cloud/) to create your own visualizations, and even create visualizations that can be privately or publick accessed.

**How does Visualization Community work?**
* VisCom is hosted in St. Jude's cloud enviornment where there is no outsource program or application to download. It only requires a computer and internet connection. It is completely free for non-profit/academic use.

* You will ***not*** incur any costs except in the following situations:

*When data driving a visualization is stored in St. Jude Cloud Genomics Platform or DNAnexus, a monthly fee will be incurred for storage costs. See your [DNAnexus billing information](https://platform.dnanexus.com/profile/settings/billing) for the cost per GB.*

**What do the visualizations represent?**
* The visuals are curated by researchers, those composed of St Jude Cloud or others within a research team. These visuals represent high dimensional proteomic or genomic data sets. 

**Can I create my own visualizations?**
* Yes, St. Jude internal users have access to create visuals now once they sign up for an account and are assigned a team. We are working on a new workflow so that you can create visuals without being on a team. 
* As an external user, please contact support@stjude.cloud so that we can help you create an account. Then, you may follow our '**Getting Started**' chapter to follow step-by-step tutorials to begin creating your own visualizations within VisCom.

**Can I share my visuals with others?**
* Yes, you may share your visualization(s) once created. Coming soon will be a sharing option within the Visualization Community platform. 

**Can I keep my visualizations private?**
* Yes, we have an access control workflow where you can create visualizations which will remain private until you get approval from the team P.I. or Team Lead to to make it public. 

**Can I use these in a publication?**
* Yes, you may use these sophisticated figures in your publications. We currently have published visualizations in over 11 prestigious journals including Nature, Cancer Discovery, Blood, and Cell Reports. 

**Do I have to upload my own PDF or what do I need to generate the interactive visualization?**
* You do not need to upload a PDF. You can either use ProteinPaint/GenomePaint as an internal user or follow our step-by-step tutorials to create a visual.
* While we have curated examples, custom content is allowed. 

**Can I access the data used to generate the visualizations?** 
* You can access the data within each Community on the 'Data tab' or by clicking the data source icon above each individual visualization.

**Can I build a Community?**
* Yes, you can curate a public or private Community to unify the visualizations and publications that are associated to propel the scientific community.
