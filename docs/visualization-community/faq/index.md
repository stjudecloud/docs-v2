KeyWord(s): VisCom (Visualization Community)
 
**What is Visualization Community?**
* [Visualization Community](https://viz.stjude.cloud/) is a safe environment where you can navigate published versus non-published research visualizations, learn to use ProteinPaint/GenomePaint to create your own visualizations, and even create visualizations that can be privately accessed or shared with others.
* Once you find the visualization you need, you can easily re-create it utilizing innovative tools and then display the data dynamically for a streamlined experience.
 
**How does Visualization Community work?**
* VisCom is hosted in St. Jude's cloud enviornment where there is no outsource program or application to download. It only requires a computer and internet connection. It is completely free for non-profit/academic use.
 
* You will ***not*** incur any costs except in the following situations:
 
   1) When data driving a visualization is stored in St. Jude Cloud Genomics Platform or DNAnexus, a monthly fee will be incurred for storage costs. See your [DNAnexus billing information](https://platform.dnanexus.com/profile/settings/billing) for the cost per GB.
 
**What do the visualizations represent?**
* The visuals are curated by researchers, those composed of St Jude Cloud or others within a research team. These visuals can be searched by lab, research domain, or data type.
* Coming soon will be Communities where visuals are grouped by study and the affiliated publications. This will drive related data to propel discoveries.
 
**Can I create my own visualizations?**
* Yes, St. Jude internal users have access to create visuals now once they sign up for an account and are assigned a team. We are working on a wizard so you can create visuals without being on a team.
* As an external user, please contact our team so that we can help you create an account. Then, you may follow our COMING SOON 'Visualize Your Data' Chapter to follow step-by-step tutorials to begin creating your own visualizations.
 
**Can I share my visuals with others?**
* Yes, you may share your visualization once createdd. Coming soon will be a sharing option within the Visualization Community platform.
 
**Can I keep my visualizations private?**
* Yes, we have an access control workflow where you can create visualizations which will remain private until you get approval to publish and share.
 
**Can I use these in a publication?**
* Yes, you may use these sophisticated images in your publications. We currently have published visualizations in over 11 prestigious Journals including Nature, Cancer Discovery, Blood, and Cell reports.
 
**Do I have to upload my own PDF or what do I need to generate the interactive visualization?**
* You do not need to upload a PDF. You can either use ProteinPaint/GenomePaint as an internal user or follow our step-by-step tutorials (coming soon) to create a visual.
* While we have curated examples, custom content is allowed.
 
**Can I access the data used to generate the visualizations?**
* You can access the data within each Community on the 'Data tab' or by clicking the data source icon above each individual visualization.
 
**Can I build a Community?**
* Yes, you can curate a public or private Community to unify the visualizations and publications that are associated to propel the scientific community.
