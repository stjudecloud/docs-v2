## Metadata

Each data request includes a text file called `SAMPLE_INFO.txt` that provides a number of file level properties (sample identifiers, clinical attributes, etc).

### Standard Metadata

 Below are the set of tags which *may* exist for any given file in St. Jude Cloud. All optional metadata will have `sj_` prepended to their tag name.

| Property             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `sj_long_disease_name` | Please find more information about our ontology [here](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/genomics-platform/about-our-data/ontology).|
| `sj_diseases`          | If your data request was process after August 18, 2020, the field should be interpreted as the harmonized St. Jude Cloud diagnosis based on the best available information (data provided by the lab or PI and followup by scientists on the St. Jude Cloud team). If your data request was processed before August 18, 2020, this field should be interpreted as the disease identifier assigned at the time of genomic sequencing (keyly, the diagnosis known at the time of genomic testing may not be the best available information). **If your data request was processed after August 18, 2020 and you'd like to use the most up to date, harmonized diagnosis**, we recommend using `sj_diseases` when including diagnosis in your analysis. If your data request was made before this time *or* if you wish to use the values exactly as provided by the lab or PI, we recommend using the lab-provided value in `attr_diagnosis`. |

### Clinical and Phenotypic Information

Also included is a set of phenotypic information queried from the physician or research team's records at the time of sample submission to St. Jude Cloud. These are all considered to be *optional*, as the level of information gathered for each sample varies. If empty, the physician or research team did not indicate a value for the field. All basic clinical or phenotypic information will have `attr_` prepended to their tag name.

### Disease Codes

!!!note
During the release of the St. Jude Cloud paper, we undertook a massive effort to curate and harmonize diagnosis values within St. Jude Cloud. We provide two values for diagnosis, and you should select carefully which value you use based on your use case:

1. `sj_diseases`, which, since August 18, 2020, represents the harmonized diagnosis value curated by scientists on the St. Jude Cloud team (before that time it represented the diagnosis known at time of sequencing).
2. `attr_diagnosis`, which contains the unharmonized diagnosis value directly as it was submitted to us from the lab or PI.
3. `attr_diagnosis_group` TBD
4. `sj_associated_diagnoses` TBD

**If your data request was processed after August 18, 2020 and you'd like to use the most up to date, harmonized diagnosis**, we recommend using `sj_diseases` field. If your data request was made before this time *or* if you wish to use the values exactly as provided by the lab or PI, we recommend using the value in `attr_diagnosis`.
!!!

The `SAMPLE_INFO.txt` file that comes with your data request will contain the list of associated harmonized diagnosis codes (`sj_diseases`) for each sample. These codes represent the harmonized diagnosis values curated by the St. Jude Cloud team and reflect the most up to date information about the sample. For more information about our full ontology, please navigate to the [Ontology section](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/genomics-platform/about-our-data/ontology) to read our white paper and access our downloadable disease ontology.
