title: Accounts and Billing
---


St. Jude Cloud is built on top of [DNAnexus](https://www.dnanexus.com/), a data-analysis and management platform that specializes in the field of bioinformatics. All of our account management is shared between St. Jude Cloud and DNAnexus. In other words, if you have a DNAnexus account, you automatically have a St. Jude Cloud account, and vice versa. 

!!!warning St. Jude Employees
The account creation and login process is slightly different if you are an internal user (you work at St. Jude). Internal users please go to the [intranet home page](https://home.stjude.org) and type 'Bioinformatics Self-Service' into the search bar. From there, click on the link that says 'Bioinformatics Self-Service on St. Jude Cloud' to access the internal guide to creating an account.

### Billing Setup

Data from St. Jude Cloud is available for free via the DNAnexus platform, but to submit a request and access the data, your DNAnexus billing account must be setup, which includes providing a source of funds. For a more detailed explanation of what is freely available and what actions would incur costs, [see our FAQ](../faq#will-i-be-charged-for-using-st-jude-cloud-genomics-platform).
