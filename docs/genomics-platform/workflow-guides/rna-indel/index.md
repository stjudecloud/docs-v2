## Workflow Steps

*description of algorithm(s) or workflow steps*


## Additional Info

*description of any additional information that the user might need to know/do before running the workflow*


## Creating a workspace
Before you can run one of our workflows, you must first create a workspace in DNAnexus for the run. Refer to [the general workflow guide](../../analyzing-data/running-sj-workflows/#getting-started) to learn how to create a DNAnexus workspace for each workflow run.

You can navigate to the **workflow name** workflow page [here]().

## Uploading Input files

*note any additional information the user should know about what input files are required* 

Refer to [the general workflow guide](../../analyzing-data/running-sj-workflows/#uploading-files) to learn how to upload input files to the workspace you just created.

## Running the Workflow

Refer to [the general workflow guide](../../analyzing-data/running-sj-workflows/#running-the-workflow) to learn how to launch the workflow, hook up input files, adjust parameters, start a run, and monitor run progress.

*!!!warning
any cautionary notes specific to running this workflow*

## Analysis of Results
Each tool in St. Jude Cloud produces a visualization that makes understanding results more accessible than working with excel spreadsheet or tab delimited files. This is the primary way we recommend you work with your results. 

Refer to [the general workflow guide](../../analyzing-data/running-sj-workflows/#custom-visualizations) to learn how to access these visualizations.

We also include the raw output files for you to dig into if the visualization is not sufficient to answer your research question.

Refer to [the general workflow guide](../../analyzing-data/running-sj-workflows/#raw-results-files) to learn how to access raw results files.
