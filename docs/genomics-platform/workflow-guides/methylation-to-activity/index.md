## Overview

MethylationToActivity (M2A) is a machine learning framework using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to infer histone modification (HM) enrichment from whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). To date, both H3K27ac and H3K4me3 enrichment prediction from WGBS is supported, from a tab-delimited text file format of M-values. Optionally, we also support transfer-learning where a user may have matching H3K27ac or H3K4me3 data with appropriate controls in addition to WGBS data.

## Preparing to run M2A

Before you can run one of our workflows, you must first create a workspace in DNAnexus for the run. Refer to [the general workflow guide](../../analyzing-data/running-sj-workflows/#getting-started) to learn how to create a DNAnexus workspace for each workflow run.

Refer to [the general workflow guide](../../analyzing-data/running-sj-workflows/#uploading-files) to learn how to upload input files to the workspace you just created.

Refer to [the general workflow guide](../../analyzing-data/running-sj-workflows/#running-the-workflow) to learn how to launch the workflow, hook up input files, adjust parameters, start a run, and monitor run progress.

## Analysis of Results

Today, the M2A pipeline does not produce an interactive visualization. If M2A with Transfer was run, the easiest measurment of training prediction accuracy would be caluclating the Pearson's R<sup>2</sup>, or root mean square error (RMSE) between the measured and M2A predicted values. Furthermore, comparisons of sample-sample consistency with the same/similar cancer-type (as determiend by Pearson's R<sup>2</sup>) is a good start for a contextual understanding of the predictions produced by M2A.

Refer to [the general workflow guide](../../analyzing-data/running-sj-workflows/#raw-results-files) to learn how to access raw results files.

## Interpreting results

For the M2A pipeline, every pipeline run outputs a predictions text file (tab-delimited) for each sample. These values represent the predicted selected HM (either H3K27ac or H3K4me3) promoter region enrichment.
